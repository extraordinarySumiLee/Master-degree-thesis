This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook files used in my master's thesis,
"Statistical Analysis of Observed Binary Black Holes."

In this work, the truncated power-law (TPL) model is quantitatively compared to the observed binary black holes (BBHs) documented in GWTC-1 to GWTC-3, using the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) test.
