This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that were utilized for the analysis presented in my master's thesis titled "Statistical Analysis of Observed Binary Black Holes."
The thesis investigates the agreement between the truncated power-law (TPL) model and the observed primary mass distributions of binary black holes (BBHs) listed in GWTC-1, GWTC-2, GWTC-2.1, and GWTC-3, employing the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) test.
